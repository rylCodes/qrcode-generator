# QRLink Maker

QRLink Maker is a QR code generator with customization features, developed using the open-source JS library qr-code-styling for generating styled QR codes and an unaffiliated third-party API (https://api.tinyurl.com/) for URL shortening. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (jQuery-free) along with Tailwind CSS for styling. Toastify is used for displaying notifications.
